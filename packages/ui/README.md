# @gitnut/ui

Shared UI components for GitNut apps (Next.js and other React surfaces).

This package includes:
- Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, tables, badges)
- Simple icon wrappers
- UI utilities (formatting, classnames, copy-to-clipboard helpers)

Note: This package assumes a Tailwind setup in the host app.
